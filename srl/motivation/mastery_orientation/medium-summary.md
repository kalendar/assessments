Your score for mastery orientation is **medium**. This suggests that there are occasions when you enjoy learning just for the sake of learning and when you work hard  because you want to master skills and gain knowledge--but not always.

To enhance mastery-oriented thinking (and to avoid performance-oriented thinking): 

1.	Don’t worry about how others perform; focus on your own growth and learning. 
2.	Focus on your improvement and progress rather than a single grade.
3.	View mistakes and errors as opportunities to improve.
