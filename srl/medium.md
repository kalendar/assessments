Thank you for completing the Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) component of the Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of Colleges (DAACS). The results presented here are meant to be informative and instructional; **there is no passing or failing**. Because your results can change due to life circumstances or courses you take, you are encouraged to take SRL survey again, especially when beginning new courses.

Your responses to the SRL items suggest that while you have many strengths as a learner, there are some areas where you could enhance your self-regulation skills. The links on the left provide detailed information about different aspects of being a self-regulated learner, with recommendations for how to develop new skills. We recommend exploring areas of strength as well as weaknesses: It is good to play to your strengths while understanding and developing weak areas.
