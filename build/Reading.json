              "content": "    ...It was late in December, the last busy days of the year. But the seven or eight boys\non the windy beach were as lighthearted and free as ever. The eldest was twelve, the\nyoungest nine. They were gathered beneath a dune in lively discussion. Some were\nstanding. Others sat. One rested his chin in his hands, elbows dug deep in the sand. As they\ntalked, the sun went down in the west.\n    Their talking now over, the boys galloped off along the water's edge. From inlet to inlet\neach ran as he pleased. The group was quickly dispersed. One by one they retrieved what\nthe storm had brought two nights before and the ebb tide had left behind: rotted boards, a\nchipped bowl, bamboo slivers, chunks of wood, an old ladle with the handle torn off. The\nboys heaped them up on a dry patch of sand away from the lapping waves. All that they\ngathered was soaking wet. ...\n    The spoils of their hunt they had gathered for burning. With the red flames, wild joy\nwould be theirs. Running and leaping across, they would prove their courage. And now\nfrom the dunes they gathered dry grass. The eldest stepped forward and touched it with\nfire. They stood in a circle and waited to hear the crack of bamboo split by the flames. But\nonly the grass burned. It caught and died, caught and died. A few puffs of smoke floated\nup, nothing more. The wood, the bamboo were untouched. The mirror frame only was\ncharred here and there. With a weird hiss, steam shot out from the end of the pole. One\nafter another the boys dropped to the sand and blew at the pile as hard as they could. But\ninstead of flames, smoke arose, stinging their eyes. Their cheeks were stained with tears. ...\n    Look, look, one boy shouted, the Izu hill fires! If their fires burn, then why shouldn't\nours? All leaped to their feet, looking out towards the water. Far across the great Bay of\nSagami two fires flickered and trembled, so feeble they might be just will-o'-the-wisps. Now\nthat harvest is over, the farmers of Izu must be burning the chaff of their fields in the hills.\nSurely these are the fires that bring tears to the eyes of winter travelers. Their distant\nbeams tell only of the long, dark road ahead.\n    The boys danced wildly and clapped and sang, The hills are burning, the hills are\nburning. Their innocent voices rang through the dusk, down the long, lonely beach. The\nwhispering of the waves blended with their voices. The waves rushed in from the southern\ntip of the inlet in foaming white lines. The tide was beginning to rise. ...\n    Still vexed by their failure, the eldest boy looked back at the pile as he ran. One more\ntime he looked back from the top of the dune before running down the far side. It has\ncaught, he shouted, Our fire has caught, when he saw the flames on the beach. The others,\namazed, climbed back to the top. They stood in a row and looked down.\n    It was true. The stubborn bits of wood, fanned by the wind, had caught fire. Smoke\nbillowed up and red tongues of flame shot out, disappeared and shot out again. The sharp\ncrack of bamboo joints splitting in the fire, the shower of sparks with each report.<sup>1</sup> Indeed,\nthe fire had caught. But the boys stood their ground, clapped and shouted with joy, then\nturned and raced down the hill for home.\n    Now the ocean was dark and from the beach, too, the sun was gone. All that was left\nwas the winter night's loneliness. And on the desolate beach the fire burned, alone,\nuntended. ...\n\n- Kunikida Doppo\nexcerpted from \"The Bonfire\"\nMonumenta Nipponica: Studies in Japanese Culture, 1970\nThe Voyagers' Press\n<sup>1</sup>report - an explosive noise",

              "content": "    Handcycling was developed in the 1980s by people working to create alternate types of\nhuman-powered vehicles. So it was almost by accident that a new world of cycling was\nopened to people with disabilities. ...\n    \"The disabled community picked up on it right away,\" said Ian Lawless, Colorado\nregional director and cycling director for Adaptive Adventures. Even people with one\nworking arm can handcycle with some modifications made to the equipment, said Lawless.\n\"Just about anyone can do it. It's an accessible sport. It's not just for racing; it's also for\nrecreational riding. It's a barrier breaker that allows a disabled rider to participate in cycling\nwith friends and families who may be riding conventional bicycles.\"\n    In the 25 years since its development, handcycling has continued to grow in popularity.\nIt's been part of the IPC [International Paralympic Committee] cycling program since 1998,\nand the 2004 Paralympics included handcycling racing for the first time. Today, thousands\nof people, able-bodied and those with disabilities, have turned to handcycling as a means to\nimprove their cardiovascular health, increase upper-body strength, compete, and ride with\nfriends and family. ...\n    An upright handcycle is an entry-level bike for those who are new to the sport, who just\nwant exercise or recreation, or who don't want to ride very long distances or go very fast.\nBecause of their higher center of gravity, upright handcycles aren't suitable for speeds\nhigher than 15 mph. The internal gear systems, borrowed from the cycling industry,\nusually come in a choice of three or seven speeds, which naturally limits the speed to less\nthan 15 mph. They are easy to transfer in and out of from a wheelchair, and have a natural,\nfork-type steering system.\n    Recumbent<sup>1</sup> handcycles come in a few different variations. There are two steering\noptions: fork-steer and lean-to-steer, and two seating options: one where the rider reclines\nand the other, a \"trunk-power\" version, where the rider leans forward.

              "content": "    We are packing up the house. The air is pulpy with the smells of cardboard and\nnewsprint, and every room is lined with boxes, flaps fanned open at the top. We pack and\npack-eighty boxes already, and so far, with two weeks still to go, we haven't missed a thing.\nWhat do we keep it all for? Books and more books; unused wedding presents and\nmismatched wine glasses; worn-out stuffed animals and outgrown toys; sheaves of letters;\nboxes of loose photographs; a landfill of sweaters, shoes, and clothes: the weighty\napparatus of four lives. It will take more than two hundred book boxes, dish barrels, mirror\nboxes, mattress crates, a football field of paper, bubble wrap, and tape to contain it all. We\nwant to contain it. We want to hold it tight. ...\n    <i>There's no place like home</i>, Dorothy chants, clicking her ruby heels as she recites her\ndream-dissolving spell. I've moved half a dozen times since I first left my parents' house for\ncollege, twenty-five years ago this fall, and sometimes I wonder if there is any place I'll ever\nreally feel at home. I feel loose-footed on this spinning planet, as displaced as those\nmountains vanished in the fog. Of course, you don't have to move physically to leave\nyourself behind. Something is lost with every tick of the second hand on the clock. ...\n    My parents still live in the house in which I grew up, and my childhood room remains\nalmost exactly the way I left it when I last lived there at eighteen. It's a shrine to my\nlong-vanished child-self, a garden gone to seed, a tangle of dusty paperbacks, knickknacks,\nand disheveled dolls. My mother refuses to throw anything away, although lately she's been\nurging me to come and weed things out myself.\n    \"I don't want to leave you with a mess to clean up when I die,\" she says. Now that we're\nmoving, she says, it's time.\n    Back in Boston for a visit, I shake open a large black trash bag and sit down on the floor\nof my old room. From a built-in cabinet, I exhume a postcard of Baryshnikov in midleap, a\nsilver-plated pendant in the shape of a Hershey's Kiss, faded mimeographs of high school\nclass songs and summer reading lists, stacks of letters, a flowered fabric-covered scrapbook\n(blank). I remember each of these objects perfectly, though I haven't thought of them in\nyears. I take a breath, open the trash bag, and stuff them in.\n    My mother comes in and perches on the edge of the bed. \"You don't need to throw\n<i>everything</i> away, you know,\" she says, reaching for a postcard with a cartoon of a girl with\ngoogly eyes on the front and my long-dead paternal grandmother's spidery handwriting on\nthe back. <i>My most beloved darling</i>. It's dated August 1970. I would have been seven then,\nthe same age as my daughter now. Will we be sitting together like this, looking at postcards\nfrom my own mother, when my daughter is forty-three?\n    My mother says, \"You know, you only need to get rid of those things you don't want to\nkeep.\"\n    What don't I want? I fish the pendant out of the trash bag, fingering the Kiss's paper\npull-tab, which reads \"I Love You,\" and which, amazingly, is still in tact. I give it to my\ndaughter, along with the scrapbook and a doll with floozy blond hair and tattered clothes,\nand pack them all into yet another box to be shipped to our new Ohio home. I retrieve the\nletters, the postcards, the mimeographs; I open the cabinet and put them back.\n    To my surprise my mother is satisfied with this. In fact she seems relieved. \"Everything\nwill be here for you whenever you want it,\" she says. ...\n\n- Margot Singer\nexcerpted from \"Afterimage\"\n<i>River Teeth</i>, Spring 2008",

The program\nincluded spraying home interiors with insecticides and distributing antimalarial drugs to\npeople in affected regions. But WHO's efforts yielded only partial success. The disease did\ndisappear in Europe, Russia, Australia and most of the Caribbean. South Asia initially saw\ndramatic reductions of infections, but the disease soon bounced back. Other hotspots fared\neven worse.\n    What went wrong? In a word, everything. The parasites fought back, becoming\nresistant to common medications. The mosquitoes grew stronger too, as more and more of\nthem were able to survive insecticides. In some climates, mosquitoes bred so quickly that\ninsecticide applications simply couldn't keep up. All the while, local tribes were waging wars\nof their own, which bogged down already-inadequate health infrastructures<sup>1</sup> and made public\nhealth interventions difficult and dangerous. In 1969, WHO shut down its program.\nNational malaria-control programs followed, but they later fell into neglect or were\nabandoned entirely. ...\n    Spraying insecticides isn't the only way to use them. Mosquito-repellent bed nets<sup>2</sup>\ntreated with a class of insecticides called pyrethroids, which bind more easily to nets than\nDDT,<sup>3</sup> cost just $1 to $2 apiece in Africa. And nets give some major bang for their buck: A\nstudy published last year found that a 10-fold increase in nets resulted in 44 percent fewer\ndeaths among Kenyan children in the studied areas. In September of 2006, Kenya's\ngovernment used a $17-million Global Fund grant to provide 3.4 million\ninsecticide-treated nets to children. Zambia followed its lead. In 2006, 23 percent of\nZambian children slept under treated nets, up from 1 percent in 2000. ...\n    In the face of widespread drug resistance, scientists have turned to a flowering shrub\ncalled wormwood (<i>Artemisia annua</i>), the active ingredient of which, artemisinin, has potent\nanti-fever properties. Since 2004, when WHO began promoting the use of artemisinin\nworldwide, the drug has proved to be extremely fast-acting and effective against\n<i>P. falciparum</i>.<sup>4</sup> WHO now recommends it or its derivatives as the first line of defense\nagainst the parasite in areas where chloroquine<sup>5</sup> no longer works, such as much of\nsub-Saharan Africa. Artemisinin is now one of the most powerful tools against malaria. ...\n    Fortunately, powerful synthetic versions of the drug are on the horizon. Since 2000,\npharmaceutical scientists at the University of Nebraska Medical Center have been working\non an entirely synthetic antimalarial designed to mimic artemisinin. In preclinical lab tests,\nthe drug, called OZ277, was found to be even more effective than artemisinin derivatives.\nThe medication is currently in the last stage of clinical trials and, although a price for the\ndrug has not been determined, it will probably be less expensive than artemisinin. ...\n    Complete eradication of malaria on the scale of polio will never be achieved without a\nvaccine. Creating that magic bullet, however, has been a tremendous challenge. Obstacles\ninclude the complexity of the parasites and their ability to quickly change and adapt. We\nalso don't completely understand our bodies' immune response to them. But a vaccine is\nfinally on the horizon. Over the past 25 years, the pharmaceutical company\nGlaxoSmithKline Biologicals has spent $300 million developing a malaria vaccine against\n<i>P. falciparum</i>.

              "content": "    That night, Susan and I stood on the banks of the river, which was moving blackly with\nits load of white ice floes.<sup>1</sup> The floes were flat on the top and big as the floor of my cabin.\nSome were as big as a river barge. They all moved downstream in a ghostly procession,\nseparated by jagged black lines where the water was bare. The edges crunched when they\ntouched and hissed when they swept by. In the center of the river, where the current ran\nswifter, a band of floes moved much more quickly than those near the sides.\n    The moon was full, which would make the footing easier for Susan, for she must jump\nfrom floe to floe to cross the river. We stood alone-hand in hand at the edge of water, our\nskin separated by the wool of our mittens. No other eyes, no other soul, would watch her\ngo. Silence, stillness, cold. They chimed about us as one snowy chord. ...\n    When I saw Susan step upon the ice, I bit my lower lip till the blood flowed down my\nchin and crusted in the cold. Here the riverbank was no higher than a step, as from house\nto yard. In the moonlight, new snow like sugar glittered atop the sheet of ice lying along the\nbank. Behind her, in a lengthening path, Susan's footprints indented the sparkling snow. She\nmoved toward the center of the river as calmly as though crossing a broad\nmoonlit road cut through the brush and trees of the wilderness.\n    When she came to the first black edge, she stepped across the open water as though it\nwere a mere stream.

Soon the current would sweep Susan's floe beyond\nmy sight. <i>O, carry her close, carry her close, now,</i> I prayed to the ice, and I prayed that\nSusan would not feel herself passing beyond my sight and take the risk of trying to jump\nashore when the gulf remained too great. The floe that wheeled her toward the far shore\nwas like the palm of a hand, open and presentational.\n    Patient Susan! Her ice raft nudged the shore, and she jumped. Even as her shoes\nlanded on the snowy bank, she turned and looked exactly where I stood. Together we\nlifted our arms, blowing each other a kiss across the water, for we had not kissed on\nparting, saving it till she should be safe, and trusting the sweet air to be our go-between.\nAnd then one shout, though it was small from the distance, from Susan: <i>Freedom!</i>\n\n- Sena Jeter Naslund\nexcerpted from <i>Ahab's Wife</i>, 1999\nWilliam Morrow and Company, Inc.\n\n<sup>1</sup>floes - pieces of moving ice\n<sup>2</sup>stitch - sharp pain",

              "content": "    Lynda LaPlante, 45, just wanted to do something nice for her boyfriend, Roland. So\nwhen she heard that singer John Mayer was performing at the Tweeter Center in Mansfield,\nMassachusetts, she surfed the Internet hoping to buy a pair of tickets. A \"Buy Tickets Now\"\nWeb link took LaPlante to TheSeats.com, where she nabbed two lawn seats at $60 each,\nplus an additional $15 for shipping and $18 in service fees. Total price: $153.\n    Too bad the tickets really cost $24.95 each. Unbeknownst to LaPlante, she had just\nmade a way-overpriced, sorry-no-refunds deal on an Internet ticket site. There are two\ntypes of ticket sellers, on the Web: the first, primary sellers, includes box offices and\nauthorized companies such as Ticketmaster and Tickets.com. The next group is known as\nsecondary sellers. These more risky dot-coms range from ticket brokers-companies that\nscoop up in-demand tickets and resell them for more than face value (using automated\nsoftware and phone banks, resellers can snap up thousands of tickets within minutes of a\nsale)-to marketplace websites such as StubHub, RazorGator, eBay, and Craigslist, where\nindividuals can sell tickets for any price, with almost zero guarantees for the buyer. The\nresult: a Wild West ticket market that's become anywhere from a $3 billion to $20 billion\nindustry.\n    One of the scalper's best weapons: deception. Thanks to the Internet, sellers can lure\nbuyers to sites that look official but are actually havens for high-priced tickets. That's how\nAARP THE MAGAZINE deputy editor Nancy Graham, 51, was duped. While searching the\nInternet for \"Wolf Trap\"-a performing arts center in Virginia-and \"tickets,\" she\nmistakenly ended up on GreatSeats.com and bought a pair of orchestra seats to a Doobie\nBrothers concert for $160 each. Face value $40. \"I feel like a fool,\" she says. ...\n    Price, however, isn't the only problem: all too often buyers of scalped tickets don't get\nwhat they paid for. Arline Zatz, 69, forked over $200 for two $25 seats she bought while\npersonally visiting a local broker. \"I knew they were overpriced and I resented it, but I took\nthem because they were supposedly in a superior location,\" she says. Instead, her view was\nblocked by a large television camera. Adding to her irritation: \"We saw plenty of empty\nseats.\"...\n    Some artists are fighting back. In 2006 rock star Tom Petty launched a new fan club to\ngive faithful followers the first shot at the best seats for his summer tour. When ticket\nbrokers and independent scalpers joined the club to buy and then resell premium seats for\nfive times their retail value, Petty's management and promoters had the last laugh.\nTicketmaster, the official distributor for Petty's tour, and the various arenas painstakingly\nmatched seat locations listed for sale online with those purchased during the fan-club\npresale-and voided more than 1,400 tickets so they could be resold to true fans. Buyers\nhad to show an ID to pick up their tickets on show night. Petty's manger, Tony Dimitriades,\ncalls it \"a step in the right direction and a major strike on behalf of the good guys.\" ...\n    Even industry giant Ticketmaster is making a stand with its online channel, \"Stop the\nScammers\" (www.ticketmaster.com/stopthescammers). The site allows consumers to report\nticket fraud and includes links to consumer-protection agencies. ...\n\n- Laura Daily\nexcerpted from \"Good Seats, Bad Deals\"\n<i>AARP THE MAGAZINE</i>, May/June 2007",

Within twelve years he had become\none of the country's leading urban planners. Ironically, Gruen's intention was not to create\na new and more efficient way of shopping but to recreate in America something of the\nunrushed cafe-society atmosphere of European city centers. Shopping centers-or\n<i>shopping towns</i>, as he preferred to call them-were to be gathering places for the\nneighborhood, focal points of the community where people could stroll and meet their\nfriends, dally over a coffee or an ice cream, and only incidentally shop. Gruen was\nconvinced that he was designing a system that would slow suburban sprawl and tame the\nautomobile. How wrong he was. ...\n    Shopping centers didn't just transform towns, they often effectively created them. In\nthe late 1940s, Paramus, New Jersey, was a dying little community with no high school, no\ndowntown to speak of, and almost no industry or offices. Then two shopping centers were\nbuilt along Route 4-Macy's Garden State Plaza and Allied Stores' Bergen Mall. Within a\ndecade, Paramus's population had more than quadrupled to 25,000 and its retail sales had\nshot up from $5 million to $125 million. Much the same thing happened to Schaumburg,\nIllinois. In 1956, it had 130 people. Then two things happened: O'Hare became Chicago's\nmain airport and the Woodfield Shopping Center, with over two million square feet of retail\nspace, was opened. By 1978, Schaumburg's population had increased almost four-hundredfold\nto fifty thousand and it was on course to become the second-biggest city in Illinois after\nChicago by the turn of the century.\n    As shopping centers blossomed, downtowns began to die. Between 1948 and 1954, at\nthe height of America's postwar economic boom, downtown retailers in America's thirteen\nlargest cities lost on average a quarter of their business. One by one, downtowns grew more\nlifeless as stores and offices fled to the suburbs. Hudson's Department Store in Detroit\nclosed after watching its annual sales fall from $153 million in 1953 to $45 million in 1981,\nits last year-the victim, ironically of the automobile, the product that had brought Detroit\nits wealth. Sears closed its flagship store on State Street in Chicago in 1983. All over\nAmerica, where downtown department stores survived it was as a matter of pride or of tax\nbreaks, and seldom one of commercial logic. ...\n    Mall shopping had become America's biggest leisure activity. Mall of America of\nMinneapolis, the country's biggest mall with 4.2 million square feet of consumer-intensive\nspace (still considerably less than the world's biggest, the West Edmonton Mall in Canada,\nwith 5.2 million square feet), was forecast to attract more people than the Grand Canyon in\nits first year of business. By the early 1990s, Americans were spending on average twelve\nhours a month in shopping malls, more than they devoted to almost any activity other than\nsleeping, eating, working, and watching television.\n    And what of Victor Gruen, the man who had started it all?

Shopping centers-or\n<i>shopping towns</i>, as he preferred to call them-were to be gathering places for the\nneighborhood, focal points of the community where people could stroll and meet their\nfriends, dally over a coffee or an ice cream, and only incidentally shop. Gruen was\nconvinced that he was designing a system that would slow suburban sprawl and tame the\nautomobile. How wrong he was. ...\n    Shopping centers didn't just transform towns, they often effectively created them. In\nthe late 1940s, Paramus, New Jersey, was a dying little community with no high school, no\ndowntown to speak of, and almost no industry or offices. Then two shopping centers were\nbuilt along Route 4-Macy's Garden State Plaza and Allied Stores' Bergen Mall. Within a\ndecade, Paramus's population had more than quadrupled to 25,000 and its retail sales had\nshot up from $5 million to $125 million. Much the same thing happened to Schaumburg,\nIllinois. In 1956, it had 130 people. Then two things happened: O'Hare became Chicago's\nmain airport and the Woodfield Shopping Center, with over two million square feet of retail\nspace, was opened. By 1978, Schaumburg's population had increased almost four-hundredfold\nto fifty thousand and it was on course to become the second-biggest city in Illinois after\nChicago by the turn of the century.\n    As shopping centers blossomed, downtowns began to die. Between 1948 and 1954, at\nthe height of America's postwar economic boom, downtown retailers in America's thirteen\nlargest cities lost on average a quarter of their business. One by one, downtowns grew more\nlifeless as stores and offices fled to the suburbs. Hudson's Department Store in Detroit\nclosed after watching its annual sales fall from $153 million in 1953 to $45 million in 1981,\nits last year-the victim, ironically of the automobile, the product that had brought Detroit\nits wealth. Sears closed its flagship store on State Street in Chicago in 1983. All over\nAmerica, where downtown department stores survived it was as a matter of pride or of tax\nbreaks, and seldom one of commercial logic. ...\n    Mall shopping had become America's biggest leisure activity. Mall of America of\nMinneapolis, the country's biggest mall with 4.2 million square feet of consumer-intensive\nspace (still considerably less than the world's biggest, the West Edmonton Mall in Canada,\nwith 5.2 million square feet), was forecast to attract more people than the Grand Canyon in\nits first year of business. By the early 1990s, Americans were spending on average twelve\nhours a month in shopping malls, more than they devoted to almost any activity other than\nsleeping, eating, working, and watching television.\n    And what of Victor Gruen, the man who had started it all?

              "content": "    ...Despite being overstretched, [Chef] Bugnard [of the Cordon Bleu cooking school]\nwas infinitely kind, a natural if understated showman, and he was tireless in his\nexplanations. He drilled us in his careful standards of doing everything the \"right way.\" He\nbroke down the steps of a recipe and made them simple. And he did so with a quiet\nauthority, insisting that we thoroughly analyze texture and flavor: \"But how does it <i>taste</i>,\nMadame Scheeld?\"\n    One morning he asked, \"Who will make <i>oeufs brouill's</i> today?\"\n    The GIs [my fellow students] were silent, so I volunteered for scrambled-egg duty.\nBugnard watched intently as I whipped some eggs and cream into a froth, got the frying pan\nvery hot, and slipped in a pat of butter, which hissed and browned in the pan.\n    \"<i>Non!</i>\" he said in horror, before I could pour the egg mixture into the pan. \"That is\nabsolutely wrong!\" ...\n    With a smile, Chef Bugnard cracked two eggs and added a dash of salt and pepper.\n\"Like <i>this</i>,\" he said, gently blending the yolks and whites together with a fork. \"Not too\nmuch.\"\n    He smeared the bottom and sides of the frying pan with butter, then gently poured the\neggs in. Keeping the heat low, he stared intently at the pan. Nothing happened. After a long\nthree minutes, the eggs began to thicken into a custard. Stirring rapidly with the fork,\nsliding the pan on and off the burner, Bugnard gently pulled the egg curds together-\"Keep\nthem a little bit loose; this is very important,\" he instructed. \"<i>Now</i> the cream or butter,\" he\nsaid, looking at me with raised eyebrows. \"This will stop the cooking, you see?\" I nodded,\nand he turned the scrambled eggs out onto a plate, sprinkled a bit of parsley around, and\nsaid, \"<i>Voila!</i>\" ...\n    It was a remarkable lesson. No dish, not even the humble scrambled egg, was too much\ntrouble for him. \"You never forget a beautiful thing that you have made,\" he said. \"Even\nafter you eat it, it stays with you-<i>always</i>.\" ...\n    I was in pure, flavorful heaven at the Cordon Bleu. Because I had already\nestablished a good basic knowledge of cookery on my own, the classes acted as a catalyst for\nnew ideas, and almost immediately my cooking improved. Before I'd started there, I would\noften put too many herbs and spices into my dishes. But now I was learning the French\ntradition of extracting the full, essential flavors from food-to make, say, a roasted chicken\ntaste really <i>chickeny</i>. ...\n    But not everything was perfect. Madame Brassart [the school's owner] had crammed\ntoo many of us into the class, and Bugnard wasn't able to give the individual\nattention I craved. There were times when I had a penetrating question to ask, or a fine\npoint that burned inside of me, and I simply wasn't able to make myself heard. All this had\nthe effect of making me work even harder.\n    I had always been content to live a butterfly life of fun, with hardly a care in the world.\nBut at the Cordon Bleu, and in the markets and restaurants of Paris, I suddenly\ndiscovered that cooking was a rich and layered and endlessly fascinating subject. The best\nway to describe it is to say that I fell in love with French food-the tastes, the processes,\nthe history, the endless variations, the rigorous discipline, the creativity, the wonderful\npeople, the equipment, the rituals.\n    I had never taken anything so seriously in my life-my husband and cat excepted-and\nI could hardly bear to be away from the kitchen. ...\n\n- Julia Child and Alex Prud'homme\nadapted and excerpted from <i>My Life in France</i>, 2007\nAnchor Books",

              "content": "    You never forget your first iceberg.\n    The mass of drifting ice that dwarfs your ship is so beautiful, yet so improbable\nlooking, that you simply gaze in wonder. It seems that nothing that large could be natural-\nand then it strikes you that something so enormous could only be natural.\nAnother realization soon dawns: These rock-hard floating mountains are dangerous.\nThink not only of the 1912 <i>Titanic</i> disaster but of hundreds of other accidents, most\nrecently the sinking (with no loss of life) of the Antarctic tour ship <i>Explorer</i> in\nNovember 2007. ...\n    Now, as climate change is raising global temperatures, more icebergs are being born.\nAntarctica generates far more of them than Greenland, the source of bergs in Arctic waters.\nAntarctica's are also much larger, sometimes reaching the size of small countries. Recent\ndata show the average atmospheric temperature has increased about 4.5 degrees\nFahrenheit in the western Antarctic Peninsula since the 1940s, making the region, along\nwith northwestern North America and Siberia, among the fastest warming on earth. This\njump has been implicated in the recent collapse of major ice shelves along the Antarctic\nPeninsula, including the Wilkins Ice Shelf in 2008. As a result, thousands of new icebergs\nhave calved, or broken off, from ice shelves into the Southern Ocean at an accelerated rate.\n    Even as more icebergs are being created, scientists are learning that these\ndangerous beauties are far from sterile, inert masses of ice.

M'Dear would undo\nmy braid, pour the rainwater on my head, put on a little Breck shampoo, and wash my hair.\nThe sun shone down, my mother's hands touched my head, and her fingers lathered love\ninto me. Never has my hair been so soft. Sometimes I still wash my hair in rainwater, to\nremember.\n    After our hair was clean, M'Dear would leave hers down, and, still in our swimsuits,\nwe'd hang clean clothes outside to dry on the line, with me handing her clothespins out of\na small apron she had sewn for me out of flower sacks. I have a photo of us by the\nclothesline, doing this very thing. We were working and smiling, squinting slightly in the\nsunlight. I was just about to enter first grade, just about to leave behind those motherdaughter\ndays of intimacy, of little maternal baptisms. M'Dear prepared me for that leaving\nso that it was smooth and felt natural. Not all leavings are that easily prepared for.\n    After finishing chores and when our hair was dry, M'Dear and I would go down to our\npier, just before sunset. These memories are so vivid to me that I don't need a photograph\nto see them. I carry them inside me.\n    In one memory, it is growing toward twilight. We are sitting on the pier with the La\nLuna River flowing by. ...\n    And as the sun sparkled off the cocoa-red water and the wind stirred in the tall pines,\nI stood behind my mother, my legs on either side of her, and brushed her hair. I lifted her\nlong chestnut hair up off her neck, twirled it up on top of her head, then let it fall,\nwatching its weight settle back down and around her shoulders. Then I'd lean my face into\nher hair and smell it. I can close my eyes and smell it now: sun and vanilla.\n    What I first learned about love, I learned on that dock with M'Dear. The La Luna River\nflowing by with its river sounds, the riverbanks with their lovely sweet citrus scent of\njasmine, the scent of M'Dear's hair, the oils of her scalp, the fullness of her thick, long curls\nagainst my hands, our breathing together, the closeness, her love for me-all of this knit my\nsoul together. When the fading sunlight hit the river, it bounced up to form iridescence, like\na halo, around M'Dear's head. <i>She is the most beautiful person in the universe</i>. ...\n\n- Rebecca Wells\nexcerpted from <i>The Crowning Glory of Calla Lily Ponder</i>, 2009\nHarperCollins Publishers\n\n<sup>1</sup>M'Dear - the narrator's mother",

Backus pretended to buy\na car, rent an apartment, and apply for a credit card.

Though it's too early to measure the full impact of the Great\nRecession, anecdotally the interest in personal-finance classes has risen since 2007 when\nsubprime became a four-letter word and bank failures a regular occurrence. Now, a handful\nof states including Missouri, Utah, and Tennessee require teenagers to take financial literacy\nclasses to graduate from high school. School districts such as Chicago are boosting\ntheir offerings in money-management classes for kids as young as elementary school, and\nroughly 300 colleges or universities now offer online personal-finance classes for incoming\nstudents. \"These classes really say, 'This is how you live independently,'\" says Ted Beck,\npresident of National Endowment for Financial Education.\n    Rather than teach investment strategies or financial wizardry, these courses offer a backto-\nthe-basics approach to handling money: Don't spend what you don't have. Put part of\nyour monthly salary into a savings account, and invest in the stock market for the long-term\nrather than short-term gains. For Backus, this means dividing her earnings from her\npart-time job at a fast-food restaurant into separate envelopes for paying bills, spending,\nand saving. \"Money is so hard to make but so easy to spend,\" she says one weekday after\nschool. \"That was the big takeaway.\"\n    Teaching kids about the value of cash certainly is one of the programs' goals, but teachers\nalso want students to think hard about their finances long term.

School districts such as Chicago are boosting\ntheir offerings in money-management classes for kids as young as elementary school, and\nroughly 300 colleges or universities now offer online personal-finance classes for incoming\nstudents. \"These classes really say, 'This is how you live independently,'\" says Ted Beck,\npresident of National Endowment for Financial Education.\n    Rather than teach investment strategies or financial wizardry, these courses offer a backto-\nthe-basics approach to handling money: Don't spend what you don't have. Put part of\nyour monthly salary into a savings account, and invest in the stock market for the long-term\nrather than short-term gains. For Backus, this means dividing her earnings from her\npart-time job at a fast-food restaurant into separate envelopes for paying bills, spending,\nand saving. \"Money is so hard to make but so easy to spend,\" she says one weekday after\nschool. \"That was the big takeaway.\"\n    Teaching kids about the value of cash certainly is one of the programs' goals, but teachers\nalso want students to think hard about their finances long term. It's easy for teenagers to get\nriled up about gas prices because many of them drive cars.

Though the\npersonal savings rate has shot up to 4.2 percent as of July 2009, that's still a far distance from\n1982, when Americans saved 11.2 percent of their incomes.

If you walked out there, you had to go through the big\npasture by the north pond. That pasture had tall fescue grass you had to wade through. If\nyou sat down, the horizon vanished, the trees on the edge of the field vanished. You could\nsee just a few feet into the grass, and you could see sky. That was all. You could flatten down\nthe grass to make a little sitting area. You could make a path to another sitting area and have\ntwo sitting areas and a path. Of course, once the grass was cut for hay, there'd be no more\nof that kind of thing. The grass on the front hill was the same.\n    They were wild blackberries. Picking them was fun for about the first twelve berries,\nthen it was work, but you were allowed to eat as many as you wanted. Fresh blackberries\nmeant you got a cobbler for dinner.

It was almost the best thing a person could\neat.

That's what it was. It was all\nof that.\n    The brambles would scratch you when you were picking berries. Like how a kitten\nscratches you on your arms, even though they don't mean it. Also, there were ticks,\nchiggers and poison ivy. The hazards of the blackberry patch. You never saw any snakes out\nthere, but for some reason you were always told that there might be snakes. A watchful eye\nwas required.\n    It felt like a long way from the house, even though you could look across the pastures\nand see the house on the hill, residing in the elm shade. Still, it felt like you were really out\nsomewhere. You knew the creek was not too far away. You couldn't hear any roads from\nthere. If you looked up, maybe there was a jet making a line in the sky.

If you change the angle of the nose versus the horizon by even \none degree while traveling at a typical commercial airliner speed of seven nautical miles a \nminute, it's enough to increase or decrease your rate of climb or descent by seven hundred \nfeet per minute.

The\nboat snagged and swamped under the weight, sinking to the bottom of the river. It was\nfound a century later, under 30 feet of silt a little north of Omaha, Neb[raska].\n    Among the canned food items retrieved from the Bertrand in 1968 were brandied\npeaches, oysters, plum tomatoes, honey, and mixed vegetables. In 1974, chemists at the\nNational Food Processors Association (NFPA) analyzed the products for bacterial \ncontamination and nutrient value. Although the food had lost its fresh smell and \nappearance, the NFPA chemists detected no microbial growth and determined that the\nfoods were as safe to eat as they had been when canned more than 100 years earlier. ...\n    Canned foods are more than a relic dug from the past. They make up 12 percent of \ngrocery sales in the United States. More than 1,500 food products are canned-including\nmany that aren't available fresh in most areas, such as elderberry, guava, mango, and about\n75 different juice drinks. Consumers can buy at least 130 different canned vegetable \nproducts-from artichokes and asparagus to turnips and zucchini. More than a dozen kinds\nof beef are canned, including beef burgers and chopped, corned and barbecued beef. ...\n    Food-spoiling bacteria, yeasts and molds are naturally present in foods. To grow, these\nmicroorganisms need moisture, a low-acid environment (acid prevents bacterial growth),\nnutrients, and an appropriate (usually room) temperature.\n    Dennis Dignan, Ph.D., chief of FDA's [Food and Drug Administration's] food processing\nsection, explains that foods are preserved from food spoilage by controlling one or more of\nthe above factors. For instance, frozen foods are stored at temperatures too low for \nmicroorganisms (bacteria, yeasts and molds) to grow. When foods are dried, sufficient \nmoisture is not available to promote growth.\n    It is the preservation process that distinguishes canned from other packaged foods.\nDuring canning, the food is placed in an airtight (hermetically sealed) container and heated\nto destroy microorganisms. The hermetic seal is essential to ensure that microorganisms do\nnot contaminate the product after it is sterilized through heating, says Dignan. Properly\ncanned foods can be stored unrefrigerated indefinitely without fear of their spoiling or\nbecoming toxic. ...\n    Dignan also notes that foods packaged in materials other than metal cans are considered\n\"canned\" by food processing specialists if the food undergoes the canning preservation\nprocess. Thus, today a canned food may be packaged in a number of other types of \ncontainers, such as glass jars, paperboard cans, and plastics that can be formed into anything\nfrom pouches to soup bowls to serving trays. ...\n    Foods with a naturally high acid content-such as tomatoes, citrus juices, pears, and\nother fruits-will not support the growth of food poisoning bacteria. In tests, when large\nnumbers of food poisoning bacteria are added to these foods, the bacteria die within a day.\n(The exact amount of time depends upon the bacteria and amount of acidity.) Foods that\nhave a high acid content, therefore, do not receive as extreme a heat treatment as low-acid\nfoods. They are heated sufficiently to destroy bacteria, yeasts and molds that could cause\nfood to spoil. ...\n    Low-acid canned foods receive a high dose of heat-usually 107 degrees Celsius \n(250 degrees Fa[h]renheit) for at least three minutes. (The amount of time the food is heat-\ned, though, depends upon the size of the container and the product.) The canned food \nis heated in a retort, a kind of pressure cooker. ...\n    Another critical element in the canned food process is sealing products in airtight \ncontainers. It is essential that air be removed from the container before sealing. Air could\ncause the can to expand during heating, perhaps damaging the seals or seams of the \ncontainer.\n    A telltale sign of loss of this vacuum<sup>1</sup> -and a possibly contaminated product-is a can\nwith bulging ends. If a seal is not airtight, bacteria may enter the can, multiply, and \ncontaminate the product. ...\n\n- Dale Blumenthal\nexcerpted and adapted from \"The Canning Process\"\n<i>FDA Consumer</i>, September 1990\n\n<sup>1</sup>vacuum - an airtight seal",

The\nboat snagged and swamped under the weight, sinking to the bottom of the river. It was\nfound a century later, under 30 feet of silt a little north of Omaha, Neb[raska].\n    Among the canned food items retrieved from the Bertrand in 1968 were brandied\npeaches, oysters, plum tomatoes, honey, and mixed vegetables. In 1974, chemists at the\nNational Food Processors Association (NFPA) analyzed the products for bacterial \ncontamination and nutrient value. Although the food had lost its fresh smell and \nappearance, the NFPA chemists detected no microbial growth and determined that the\nfoods were as safe to eat as they had been when canned more than 100 years earlier. ...\n    Canned foods are more than a relic dug from the past. They make up 12 percent of \ngrocery sales in the United States. More than 1,500 food products are canned-including\nmany that aren't available fresh in most areas, such as elderberry, guava, mango, and about\n75 different juice drinks. Consumers can buy at least 130 different canned vegetable \nproducts-from artichokes and asparagus to turnips and zucchini. More than a dozen kinds\nof beef are canned, including beef burgers and chopped, corned and barbecued beef. ...\n    Food-spoiling bacteria, yeasts and molds are naturally present in foods. To grow, these\nmicroorganisms need moisture, a low-acid environment (acid prevents bacterial growth),\nnutrients, and an appropriate (usually room) temperature.\n    Dennis Dignan, Ph.D., chief of FDA's [Food and Drug Administration's] food processing\nsection, explains that foods are preserved from food spoilage by controlling one or more of\nthe above factors. For instance, frozen foods are stored at temperatures too low for \nmicroorganisms (bacteria, yeasts and molds) to grow. When foods are dried, sufficient \nmoisture is not available to promote growth.\n    It is the preservation process that distinguishes canned from other packaged foods.\nDuring canning, the food is placed in an airtight (hermetically sealed) container and heated\nto destroy microorganisms. The hermetic seal is essential to ensure that microorganisms do\nnot contaminate the product after it is sterilized through heating, says Dignan. Properly\ncanned foods can be stored unrefrigerated indefinitely without fear of their spoiling or\nbecoming toxic. ...\n    Dignan also notes that foods packaged in materials other than metal cans are considered\n\"canned\" by food processing specialists if the food undergoes the canning preservation\nprocess. Thus, today a canned food may be packaged in a number of other types of \ncontainers, such as glass jars, paperboard cans, and plastics that can be formed into anything\nfrom pouches to soup bowls to serving trays. ...\n    Foods with a naturally high acid content-such as tomatoes, citrus juices, pears, and\nother fruits-will not support the growth of food poisoning bacteria. In tests, when large\nnumbers of food poisoning bacteria are added to these foods, the bacteria die within a day.\n(The exact amount of time depends upon the bacteria and amount of acidity.) Foods that\nhave a high acid content, therefore, do not receive as extreme a heat treatment as low-acid\nfoods. They are heated sufficiently to destroy bacteria, yeasts and molds that could cause\nfood to spoil. ...\n    Low-acid canned foods receive a high dose of heat-usually 107 degrees Celsius \n(250 degrees Fa[h]renheit) for at least three minutes.

The call to prayer wavered from the village mosque, and it\nseemed to Muda that he could see it, waves of sound shimmering concurrently with the\nmidday heat. It was the end of the fruit season, one of the last hot weeks before the rains\nbegan, and the weather was a fiery hand against his back. Muda walked with his straw hat\npulled down low over his forehead, so he didn't see the children running toward him until\nthey were quite near. They circled around him and pulled in close, like the petals on a closing\nflower.\n    \"Pachik Muda.\" It was his oldest nephew, a boy named Amin. He was wearing shorts\nand holding the hand of his youngest sister, Maimunah, who stood brown and naked beside\nhim. \"Uncle, our mother says for you to come quickly to the river.\" ...\n    \"Tell your mother,\" he said, \"that I will come later. Right now I am going for my lunch.\"\nHe expected them to run off then. They were the children of his sister, Norliza, and they\nwere rarely naughty. But instead Amin released his sister's hand. He reached out and\ntugged at Muda's sarong.<sup>2</sup>\n    \"My mother says to come,\" he repeated. \"Please, Pachik Muda, she says it is important.\"\n    Muda sighed then, but he turned and followed the children back along the road. Red\nrambutans<sup>3</sup> and smooth green mangoes hung from the trees. He plucked some of these and\nate them as he walked, wondering what he would find on the riverbank.

It was wet with river water, and it caught the noon light like fire in her hand.\n    \"The children found it,\" she said. \"I was digging for roots.\" Norliza was a midwife,\nknown in the village for her skill with herbs and massage. She came into the jungle every\nweek to search for the healing roots and bark. \"I was digging there, near the trees by the\nriver. The children were playing next to me, sorting out the rocks for a game. This one they\nliked because of its shine. At first I did not realize. It was only when Amin washed it in the\nriver that I understood.\" Her dark eyes gleamed with an unfamiliar excitement. \"To think,\"\nshe said. \"To think he might have dropped it, and I would never have known.\"\n    Muda reached out and took the knot of gold. It was smooth, almost soft, against his \nfingers. He ran his thumb against it again and again. Some of the women drew close to\nstare. Others, he noticed, were already moving away with the news. ...\n\n- Kim Edwards\nexcerpted from \"Gold\"\n<i>The Secrets of a Fire King, </i>1997\nW. W.

This phenomenon is a resounding testament to Rockwell's\nprowess as a storyteller and is the subject of another kind of one-man show: the upcoming\nexhibition at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C., titled Telling\nStories: Norman Rockwell from the Collections of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. The\nexhibit, assembled from the private collections of these two popular film directors, will \nfeature rarely viewed pieces of Rockwell's work, including George Lucas' favorite, \n<i> Lands of Enchantment</i>, which shows a youngster imagining himself as an armor-clad knight riding\naway with a beautiful girl. The point is not the boy reading, but how the book inspires the\nboy's imagination, taking him, in idealized form, to another time and place. ...\n    \"Storytelling was very important to Norman Rockwell,\" says Lucas. \"Every image has\neither the middle or the end of a story, and you can already see the beginning even though\nit's not there.

Little wonder then, that filmmakers like Spielberg and Lucas, as well\nas others, should be so inspired by his work.\n    In directing his own scenes, Rockwell had a specific focus, just not one based on the\nstark realism in which he grew up.

Instead, Rockwell aimed to depict life in a kind of \nrealistic fantasy.

              "content": "    Norman Rockwell didn't create his celebrated images using only brush and paint. They\noften took shape first as scenes that Rockwell literally acted out, not only for his editors at\nthe [<i>Saturday Evening</i>] <i>Post </i>, but his real-life models, too. \"It was strenuous,\" he once\nexplained, \"but I felt it was the best way to get across my meaning.\" And so he would \nenthusiastically play out his visions and ideas, a one-man show packed with just the right\nexpressions, giving enough details of each persona in the scene to inspire his models and,\nmore importantly, get his editors to buy his ideas.\n    Now, more than 30 years after his death, Rockwell is still acknowledged for deftly<sup>1</sup>\nchronicling the best of 20th century American life with vignettes<sup>2</sup> of simple emotions\nevoked by everyday people. This phenomenon is a resounding testament to Rockwell's\nprowess as a storyteller and is the subject of another kind of one-man show: the upcoming\nexhibition at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C., titled Telling\nStories: Norman Rockwell from the Collections of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. The\nexhibit, assembled from the private collections of these two popular film directors, will \nfeature rarely viewed pieces of Rockwell's work, including George Lucas' favorite, \n<i> Lands of Enchantment</i>, which shows a youngster imagining himself as an armor-clad knight riding\naway with a beautiful girl. The point is not the boy reading, but how the book inspires the\nboy's imagination, taking him, in idealized form, to another time and place. ...\n    \"Storytelling was very important to Norman Rockwell,\" says Lucas. \"Every image has\neither the middle or the end of a story, and you can already see the beginning even though\nit's not there. You can see all the missing parts of the story because he took that one frame\nthat sort of tells you everything you need to know.\n    \"And, of course, in filmmaking we strive for that. We strive to get images that convey,\nvisually, a lot of information without having to spend a lot of time at it. Norman Rockwell\nwas a master at that-he was a master at telling a story in one frame,\" explains Lucas.\n    That concentration of information as well as emotion is something inherent<sup>3</sup> in\nRockwell's art. Emotion certainly spoke to Steven Spielberg when he first saw one of his\nfavorite Rockwell paintings, <i>High Dive</i>, the August 16, 1947 <i>Post</i> cover that depicts a boy\nat the top of what must be (or so we imagine from the boy's expression) a towering diving\nboard. He crouches high above a swimming pool, too afraid to either jump or climb back\ndown. The painting hangs in Spielberg's office at Amblin Entertainment because it holds a\ngreat deal of meaning for the filmmaker. ...\n    Even in the creation of their work, Spielberg and Rockwell were more similar than is\nimmediately evident. To create his meticulously detailed recollections of everyday\nAmerican life, Rockwell worked much like a film director, not just acting out the scenes in his\nimagination, but scouting locations, casting everyday people from his town for particular\nparts, choosing costumes and props, and directing his performers to make them instantly\nfamiliar to the public. Little wonder then, that filmmakers like Spielberg and Lucas, as well\nas others, should be so inspired by his work.\n    In directing his own scenes, Rockwell had a specific focus, just not one based on the\nstark realism in which he grew up.

One\ncase in point is a medieval \"garment clasp\" that was made from a pig knuckle. Lawson \nanalyzed the wear patterns and polish around a hole that had been drilled through the \ncenter of the bone and showed they were consistent with the patterns found on \"buzz\nbones,\" a type of noise maker that was used as a children's toy in some parts of Europe until\na few decades ago.

There's plenty for an avid music\narchaeologist to do without ever touching a spade.\n    The oldest indisputably musical artifacts are flutes (experts call them \"pipes\") made\nfrom the bones of birds.

              "content": "    In all years and all seasons, The Bridge was there. We could see it from the roof of the\ntenement where we lived, the stone towers rising below us from the foreshortened streets\nof downtown Brooklyn. We saw it in newspapers and at the movies and on the covers of\nbooks, part of the signature of the place where we lived. Sometimes, on summer afternoons\nduring World War II, my mother would gather me and my brother Tom and my sister,\nKathleen, and we'd set out on the most glorious of walks. We walked for miles, leaving\nbehind the green of Prospect Park, passing factories and warehouses and strange \nneighborhoods, crossing a hundred streets and a dozen avenues, seeing the streets turn\ngreen again as we entered Brooklyn Heights, pushing on, beaded with sweat, legs rubbery,\nuntil, amazingly, looming abruptly in front of us, stone and steel and indifferent, was The\nBridge.\n    It was the first man-made thing that I knew was beautiful. We could walk across it, \ngazing up at the great arc of the cables. We could hear the sustained eerie musical note they\nmade when combed by the wind (and augmented since by the hum of automobile tires),\nand we envied the gulls that played at the top of those arches. The arches were Gothic, and\nprovided a sense of awe that was quite religious. And awe infused the view of the great \nharbor, a view my mother embellished by describing to us the ships that had brought her\nand so many other immigrants to America-the Irish and the Italians and the Jews, the\nGermans, the Poles, and the Swedes, all of them crowding the decks, straining to see their\nnewfound land. What they saw first was the Statue of Liberty, and the skyline, and The\nBridge. The Brooklyn Bridge. ...\n    There was a long time in my life when I didn't see much of The Bridge, except from the\nroof or the back window. The reason was simple: Trolleys were replaced by automobiles,\nand nobody I knew in our neighborhood owned a car. But then when I was sixteen, I got a\njob in the Brooklyn Navy Yard as a sheet-metal worker, and at lunchtime we would wander\nout along the cobblestone streets beside the dry docks, and from there we could look up at\nThe Bridge. \"Now the cats that built that,\" a black welder named Fred Thompson said to\nme one day, \"they knew what they were <i>doin'</i>.\"\n    They certainly did. As I grew older, I came increasingly to see The Bridge as a \nmonument to craft. It was New York's supreme example of the Well-Made Thing. All\naround us in the sixties, the standards of craft eroded. As aestheticians<sup>1</1> proclaimed the\nvirtues of the spontaneous, or exalted the bold gesture, or condemned form as an artistic\nstraitjacket, I would cross The Bridge and wonder what they could mean. More than \ntwenty men were killed in the construction of this thing, and others were ruined for life by\naccidents and disease suffered in its service. To those men, carelessness meant death, not\nsimply for themselves, but for the human beings who would use what they were making. So\nthey had no choice: They had to make it to last. And in doing so, in caring about detail and\nfunction and strength, they saw craft triumph into art. ... \n    Of course, it is the nature of all bridges that they travel in two directions. I know dozens\nof people who traveled west on The Bridge, wandered the world, and then made the long,\nwide circle home to Brooklyn. I don't know anybody who ever did that from the Bronx.\nFrom the Manhattan shore, The Bridge still seems to whisper: \"Come, travel across me. It's\nonly 1,562 feet across the river, and over here, and beyond, lies Oz, or Camelot, or\nYoknapatawpha County.\"<sup>2</sup> And from the Brooklyn side it speaks in plain, bourgeois<sup>3</sup> tones,\nwith a plain, simple message: \"Come home.\" ...\n\n- Pete Hamill\nexcerpted from \"Bridge of Dreams\"\n<i>New York Magazine</i>, May 30, 1983\n\n<sup>1</sup> aestheticians - specialists in the nature of beauty\n<sup>2</sup> Oz, Camelot, Yoknapatawpha County - fictional places\n<sup>3</sup>bourgeois - middle class",

With a length of 24-26 inches and a\nwingspan in excess of four feet, this iridescent black bird presents an imposing sight \nespecially when it skillfully executes hawk-like flight motions during courtship displays and\nwhile guarding its nest. The raven, you see, is a bit of an aerial acrobat and seems to fly for\nthe sheer joy of it. Rolls, somersaults and even level flight upside-down may be the most\nspectacular behaviors the casual birder will be able to observe.\n    Because both birds are large, black, and similarly shaped, it can be hard to tell the \ncommon raven from the American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos). In addition to being\nsomewhat larger, ravens have a heavier beak with a decided \"Roman nose\" appearance.\nThey also have shaggy throat feathers, called hackles, which can be slicked down or fluffed\nout, apparently to aid communication. In flight, their rounded, wedge-shaped tails and\nfeathers resemble extended fingers near the ends of their wings. ...\n    The raven is both predator and scavenger. Although omnivorous, most of its diet is \nanimal matter, including insects, lizards, frogs, rodents and the eggs and young of other\nbirds. In addition, it regularly dines on carrion<sup>2</sup> and garbage.\n    The raven's sometimes inexplicable and genuinely annoying habits-they've been\nknown to harass livestock and pets, pilfer golf balls and peck holes in the skins of \nunattended light airplanes-led to human reactions that thinned its ranks, particularly in\nthe Northeast. This bird has made a remarkable comeback in the last few decades, \nhowever, partly due to its ability to take advantage of the presence of people. The raven can\nsurvive everything from arctic to desert conditions, often aided, ironically, by garbage\ndumps and other artifacts of human settlement. ...\n    Raven pairs stay together throughout the breeding season and usually bond for life.\nCourtship displays generally begin in February, just before breeding. Pairs often return to\nprevious nesting areas and begin a spectacular aerial courtship ritual. They perform unison\nflight maneuvers, sometimes circling their chosen nest site with wingtips nearly touching.\nOccasionally, the male takes steep, sudden dives or tumbles in mid-air. Feather-preening\nseems to be a common activity while earthbound.\n    Ravens prefer remote, forested areas with tall coniferous trees or rocky ledges where\nthey can build nests and catch air currents that loft them into soaring flights. They also nest\non rugged seacoasts and forested marine islands, as are found off the coast of Maine. ...\n    Nests tend to be built in solitary places, typically miles from other raven nests.\nSometimes, new nests are built atop old ones, although nesting pairs may alternate among\ntwo or more sites in the same nesting area from year to year. In this way, the best nesting\nareas can be used for 100 years or more. ...\n    Many a researcher has discovered firsthand the cunning ways of the raven. Generally\nacknowledged to be among the most intelligent of birds, ravens display a seeming social\nawareness, even with other species, and surprising problem-solving abilities.\n    Accounts abound of ravens closely following large predators such as wolves or coyotes,\nand of sharing, unmolested, in their kills once the carnivores opened the carcasses.\nAlthough this could be seen as just opportunistic feeding, the easy relationship between the\nspecies seems to hint at something more substantial.\n    Inuit<sup>3</sup> hunting traditions advise watching where ravens circle and dip their wings as a\nsure tipoff to the location of game. Some speculate that ravens actually use their aerial \nvantage points to guide larger, stronger predators to prey, which they then share. ...\n\n- Brian W.

It was just an\nold habit he had, left over from wilder times: checking, looking for [a] sign of one kind or\nanother, honing his instincts, as much as anything. In his years as a Ranger captain it had\nbeen his habit to get off by himself for a time, every night, out of camp and away from \nwhatever talking and bickering were going on. He had discovered early on that his instincts\nneeded privacy in which to operate. Sitting around a fire being sociable, yawning and \nyarning, might be fine in safe country, but it could cost you an edge in country that wasn't\nso safe. He liked to get off by himself, a mile or so from camp, and listen to the country, not\nthe men.\n    Of course, real scouting skills were superfluous in a place as tame as Lonesome Dove,\nbut Call still liked to get out at night, sniff the breeze and let the country talk. The country\ntalked quiet; one human voice could drown it out, particularly if it was a voice as loud as\nAugustus McCrae's. Augustus was notorious all over Texas for the strength of his voice. On\na still night he could be heard at least a mile, even if he was more or less \nwhispering. Call did his best to get out of range of Augustus's voice so that he could relax\nand pay attention to other sounds. If nothing else, he might get a clue as to what weather\nwas coming-not that there was much mystery about the weather around Lonesome Dove.\nIf a man looked straight up at the stars he was apt to get dizzy, the night was so clear. Clouds\nwere scarcer than cash money, and cash money was scarce enough.\n    There was really little in the way of a threat to be looked for, either. A coyote might\nsneak in and snatch a chicken, but that was about the worst that was likely to happen. The\nmere fact that he and Augustus were there had long since discouraged the local\nhorsethieves. ...\n    He tried hard to keep sharp, but in fact the only action he had scared up in six months\nof watching the river was one bandit, who might just have been a <i>vaquero</i><sup>1</sup> with a thirsty\nhorse. All Call had had to do in that instance was click the hammer of his Henry-in the\nstill night the click had been as effective as a shot. The man wheeled back into Mexico, and\nsince then nothing had disturbed the crossing except a few mangy goats on their way to the\nsalt lick. ...\n    But somehow, despite the dangers, Call had never felt pressed in quite the way he had\nlately, bound in by the small but constant needs of others. The physical work didn't matter:\nCall was not one to sit on a porch all day, playing cards or gossiping. He intended to work;\nhe had just grown tired of always providing the example. He was still the Captain, but no\none had seemed to notice that there was no troop and no war. He had been in charge so\nlong that everyone assumed all thoughts, questions, needs, and wants had to be referred to\nhim, however simple these might be.

Sitting around a fire being sociable, yawning and \nyarning, might be fine in safe country, but it could cost you an edge in country that wasn't\nso safe. He liked to get off by himself, a mile or so from camp, and listen to the country, not\nthe men.\n    Of course, real scouting skills were superfluous in a place as tame as Lonesome Dove,\nbut Call still liked to get out at night, sniff the breeze and let the country talk. The country\ntalked quiet; one human voice could drown it out, particularly if it was a voice as loud as\nAugustus McCrae's. Augustus was notorious all over Texas for the strength of his voice. On\na still night he could be heard at least a mile, even if he was more or less \nwhispering. Call did his best to get out of range of Augustus's voice so that he could relax\nand pay attention to other sounds. If nothing else, he might get a clue as to what weather\nwas coming-not that there was much mystery about the weather around Lonesome Dove.\nIf a man looked straight up at the stars he was apt to get dizzy, the night was so clear. Clouds\nwere scarcer than cash money, and cash money was scarce enough.\n    There was really little in the way of a threat to be looked for, either. A coyote might\nsneak in and snatch a chicken, but that was about the worst that was likely to happen. The\nmere fact that he and Augustus were there had long since discouraged the local\nhorsethieves. ...\n    He tried hard to keep sharp, but in fact the only action he had scared up in six months\nof watching the river was one bandit, who might just have been a <i>vaquero</i><sup>1</sup> with a thirsty\nhorse. All Call had had to do in that instance was click the hammer of his Henry-in the\nstill night the click had been as effective as a shot. The man wheeled back into Mexico, and\nsince then nothing had disturbed the crossing except a few mangy goats on their way to the\nsalt lick. ...\n    But somehow, despite the dangers, Call had never felt pressed in quite the way he had\nlately, bound in by the small but constant needs of others. The physical work didn't matter:\nCall was not one to sit on a porch all day, playing cards or gossiping. He intended to work;\nhe had just grown tired of always providing the example. He was still the Captain, but no\none had seemed to notice that there was no troop and no war. He had been in charge so\nlong that everyone assumed all thoughts, questions, needs, and wants had to be referred to\nhim, however simple these might be. The men couldn't stop expecting him to [c]aptain, and\nhe couldn't stop thinking he had to.

They weren't even peace \nofficers: they just ran a livery stable, trading horses and cattle when they could find a buyer.\n    The work they did was mostly work he could do in his sleep, and yet, though his day-to-day\nresponsibilities had constantly shrunk over the last ten years, life did not seem easier.

After I dropped\nanchor off the island of Unalaska, our chief diver, Raymond Coll, climbed into our diving\nsaucer and took it down for a search under the surface of the sea. Raymond, who stayed in\ncontact with me by sonar telephone, described walruses and whales, vast pink fields of\nkrill-icy waters that brimmed with life.\n    Above, on board <i>Calypso</i>, the team was uncharacteristically preoccupied with another\nendeavor altogether. NASA had just landed a module on the moon, and the entire <i>Calypso</i>\ncrew crowded onto the fantail to listen raptly to the radio, awaiting the announcement that\na human being, Neil Armstrong, was about to step onto the lunar surface.\n    Excitement electrified the atmosphere on board. We barely breathed. And then,\nArmstrong's voice. A cheer rose from the deck and echoed in the crystal air. I switched on\nmy sonar link with Coll. \"Raymond! Historic news!

Later that year he joined Alexander Graham Bell and three other members\nof the Aerial Experiment Association to help create ailerons, hinged wing flaps that enable \nairplanes to bank and turn. Curtiss went on to make America's first exhibition flight, win the\nfirst international air-speed prize at Reims, France, in 1909, and design the first practical\nseaplane.\n    In World War I he made millions with seaplanes and the Curtiss Jenny, a sturdy, \naffordable trainer that became the workhorse of barnstormers<sup>1</sup> and airmail pilots after the\nwar. In 1917 he created the Curtiss Autoplane, an unsuccessful hybrid of airplane and car.\n    In the 1920s the \"King of the Air\" found that he hankered to get back to his lifelong\nloves of hunting, fishing, and camping. At 40, he wanted more comfort for his road trips, so\nhe decided to build his own travel trailer and create a new business to do so.\n    The timing seemed right. The Roaring Twenties saw Detroit's automobile industry \nrunning full throttle; Americans flocked to the nation's highways. With so few facilities on\nthe road, many long-distance drivers simply brought their own, sometimes by building \ntrailers for themselves. ...\n    Curtiss also designed his Aerocar [travel trailer] to free passengers from the tyranny of\nbad roads. In the words of his patent application, the occupants of normal vehicles \"are \njolted and jostled about in a most objectionable manner; in fact, so much so that riding\nbecomes irksome, tiresome, and uncomfortable in the extreme.\" That was not the case for\nAerocar passengers, who could lounge in fixed armchairs, enjoying close-set windows that\ncreated 10-foot fields of vision on both sides, broken only by window posts. An occupant\ncould also stretch out on the rear-facing divan in the prow, under a built-in Philco radio. \nA table snapped into place so that passengers might play cards or sit down to a meal \ncreated in the galley,<sup>2</sup> with its two-burner gasoline stove, icebox, and sink. The chemical \ntoilet had its own private compartment.\n    A privacy curtain turned the galley into a shower. (A drain in the linoleum took care of\nthe water.) Concealed Pullman-type bunks pulled down from the roof, while armchairs\nfolded down to make additional sleeping spaces. Snap-up privacy curtains and individual\nreading lights added further amenities.\n    The Aerocar's $2,600 price tag clearly placed it in the luxury market, which made it \ndifficult to sell during the Depression. Nevertheless, sales of Aerocars managed to weather\nthe hard times, even surviving Curtiss's unexpected death in 1930 at age 52. ...\n    In the Depression year of 1936, the New York Times estimated that 100,000 trailers of\nall sorts were already on the road, while buyers were prepared to snap up another\n300,000-more than six times what the country's estimated 300 manufacturers expected to\nproduce in a year. \"A new industry is rapidly coming to the front,\" the paper said. \"It is not\nan uncommon sight these days to drive past a factory making trailers and find it operating\nfull blast in the middle of the night.

Later that year he joined Alexander Graham Bell and three other members\nof the Aerial Experiment Association to help create ailerons, hinged wing flaps that enable \nairplanes to bank and turn. Curtiss went on to make America's first exhibition flight, win the\nfirst international air-speed prize at Reims, France, in 1909, and design the first practical\nseaplane.\n    In World War I he made millions with seaplanes and the Curtiss Jenny, a sturdy, \naffordable trainer that became the workhorse of barnstormers<sup>1</sup> and airmail pilots after the\nwar. In 1917 he created the Curtiss Autoplane, an unsuccessful hybrid of airplane and car.\n    In the 1920s the \"King of the Air\" found that he hankered to get back to his lifelong\nloves of hunting, fishing, and camping. At 40, he wanted more comfort for his road trips, so\nhe decided to build his own travel trailer and create a new business to do so.\n    The timing seemed right. The Roaring Twenties saw Detroit's automobile industry \nrunning full throttle; Americans flocked to the nation's highways. With so few facilities on\nthe road, many long-distance drivers simply brought their own, sometimes by building \ntrailers for themselves. ...\n    Curtiss also designed his Aerocar [travel trailer] to free passengers from the tyranny of\nbad roads. In the words of his patent application, the occupants of normal vehicles \"are \njolted and jostled about in a most objectionable manner; in fact, so much so that riding\nbecomes irksome, tiresome, and uncomfortable in the extreme.\" That was not the case for\nAerocar passengers, who could lounge in fixed armchairs, enjoying close-set windows that\ncreated 10-foot fields of vision on both sides, broken only by window posts. An occupant\ncould also stretch out on the rear-facing divan in the prow, under a built-in Philco radio. \nA table snapped into place so that passengers might play cards or sit down to a meal \ncreated in the galley,<sup>2</sup> with its two-burner gasoline stove, icebox, and sink. The chemical \ntoilet had its own private compartment.\n    A privacy curtain turned the galley into a shower. (A drain in the linoleum took care of\nthe water.) Concealed Pullman-type bunks pulled down from the roof, while armchairs\nfolded down to make additional sleeping spaces. Snap-up privacy curtains and individual\nreading lights added further amenities.\n    The Aerocar's $2,600 price tag clearly placed it in the luxury market, which made it \ndifficult to sell during the Depression. Nevertheless, sales of Aerocars managed to weather\nthe hard times, even surviving Curtiss's unexpected death in 1930 at age 52. ...\n    In the Depression year of 1936, the New York Times estimated that 100,000 trailers of\nall sorts were already on the road, while buyers were prepared to snap up another\n300,000-more than six times what the country's estimated 300 manufacturers expected to\nproduce in a year. \"A new industry is rapidly coming to the front,\" the paper said. \"It is not\nan uncommon sight these days to drive past a factory making trailers and find it operating\nfull blast in the middle of the night. Many plants are running twenty-four hours a day, seven\ndays a week.\" At the National Automobile Show later that year, dealers displayed 50 \ndifferent models, ranging in price from $275 to $12,000. ...\n\n- Kirk W.
