The purposes of this assessment are to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>generate a profile of your SRL skills - motivation beliefs, strategic behaviors, and metacognitive skills </li>\n<li>give you feedback about your SRL skills and suggestions for improving them, as needed;</li>\n<li>direct you to online resources and strategies to further enhance your ability to manage the demands of college life.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You will be asked to respond to a series of statements about your SRL skills. For some items, you will indicate your level of agreement, whereas for others you will rate how frequently you display certain behaviors. After this SRL assessment, you will have the opportunity to review your SRL skills and the recommended strategies for improving them, as needed. </p>\n",

This is understandable, since seeking out help is not an easy thing to do. Students can feel intimidated or anxious, or like they just don&#39;t have time. They also might not know what to say or how to ask.

Erica considers herself to be a smart, hardworking professional and believes she will succeed in the course without much difficulty. During the second lesson, Erica began having trouble comprehending some course material. Instead of asking for clarification, Erica tried to figure out the confusing content on her own. She thought, &ldquo;I am smart enough to have made it this far, I should be able to do this. Plus, talking to teachers makes me nervous!&rdquo; Erica continued to push her way through each lesson, ignoring content she did not understand. As the course continued, Erica felt overwhelmed and frustrated, and she was no longer confident in her ability to do well in the course. Of greatest concern was that, because Erica had avoided certain topics, she had difficulty understanding more advanced concepts in class, which then caused her to fall further behind in her classwork.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Erica&#39;s attitude&ndash;&ldquo;I don&#39;t want to ask for help&rdquo;&ndash;is fairly common among college students.

A diverse collection of study strategies is valuable because different subjects require different approaches to learning: One course might lend itself to writing summaries of key points from a lesson in your own words, while in another it may be more useful to create concept maps to organize information. The SRL survey results suggest that you <strong>occasionally</strong> use different types of strategies to help you learn and remember information (see your responses below). You might not consistently use the most effective strategies, or perhaps, like many people, you have a limited repertoire. </p>\n\n<p>This scenario illustrates how using different strategies can help you more easily understand and remember information:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Steven, a second year college student, was feeling overwhelmed and defeated while studying for his math test. Steven&#39;s primary approach to studying was reading over the chapters and briefly reviewing his class notes. On many occasions, he became confused and did not understand what he was reading. Instead of going back and trying to understand the section, or using a different source to learn the information, he simply avoided what he did not understand. He thought to himself, &ldquo;I don&#39;t get this stuff, but I don&#39;t know what else I can do!&rdquo; When he talked to one of his classmates, Elizabeth, about his struggles, she opened up his eyes to a whole new way of studying. Elizabeth told him, &ldquo;When it comes to math, I need to do a lot of practice problems and see where I have trouble. Reading my notes is only helpful when I&#39;m trying to figure out a problem I don&#39;t understand. Taking the practice tests tells me which problems I have to study and which ones I have mastered.&rdquo; Steven asked Elizabeth where she learned this strategy. She told him that her high school teacher told her to do practice problems but she never understood their value until she read the SRL feedback.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Like many students, Steven studied for tests in a fairly narrow way. He tended to use the same study approach regardless of the class.

Nicole took more detailed class notes, asked questions to clear up confusions, and studied every week using study aids to help her master the material. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To learn more about a growth mindset and how to sustain it, click on the <strong>Learn</strong>, <strong>See</strong>, and/or <strong>Do</strong> buttons below. </p>\n\n<h2>Your Survey Responses</h2>\n",

Your responses to the SRL survey suggest that you <strong>occasionally evaluate</strong> your learning, meaning that at times you will figure out how well you learned, what worked well, and how you can improve, but you do not do these things consistently. Being a consistent self-evaluator can help you avoid  mistakes and let you know when you need to adjust or change. </p>\n\n<p>The following scenario illustrates how inconsistent self-evaluation can negatively impact learning:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Anthony, a first-year college student, was preparing for his first history exam of the semester. He studied for a few hours, memorizing key events and dates. He went to the exam confident in his ability to perform well. Much to his surprise, he received a C on the exam. While going over the test in class, Anthony realized that the professor expected him to be able to analyze historical events, not just memorize them. This misunderstanding as well as Anthony&#39;s tendency to <strong>not</strong> self-assess or check his learning while studying led him to study in ineffective ways. Anthony felt stuck and somewhat nervous because he is having another exam in a few weeks and doesn&#39;t know how to go about studying.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Anthony&#39;s experience of overestimating his learning during studying is common among college students. The key to avoiding these situations is to prompt yourself to engage in more effective self-evaluation.</p>\n\n<p>To guide you in self-evaluation, please click on the <strong>Learn</strong>, <strong>See</strong>, and/or <strong>Do</strong> buttons. </p>\n\n<h2>Your Survey Responses</h2>\n",
