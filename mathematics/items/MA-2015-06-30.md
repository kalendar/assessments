We can solve this problem using a table. Since the first
four hours cost \$30, renting the truck for 1 through 4 hours costs
\$30. The fifth hour costs an additional \$10, for a total of \$40. The
sixth hour costs \$10 more, so by then Brandon has spent \$50. We can
continue this pattern, as shown here:

  Number of hours  | Total cost
  -----------------| ------------
  1 hour           | \$30
  2 hours          | \$30
  3 hours          | \$30
  4 hours          | \$30
  5 hours          | \$40
  6 hours          | \$50
  7 hours          | \$70

We are asked to find the maximum number of hours for which Brandon can
rent the truck, if he cannot spend more than \$60. From our table, we
can see that Brandon can rent the truck for 7 hours.
