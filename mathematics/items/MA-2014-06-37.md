The student took 14 hours to knit the first sweater. The
second sweater took about 10% less time. Ten percent of 14 hours is

$$10\%\ of\ 14\ hours = 0.10 \times 14 = 1.4$$

So the second sweater took 1.4 hours less than the first sweater, or
14-1.4 = 12.6 hours. We could have done this calculation in fewer steps
by noticing that if the second sweater took 10% less time, then it took
90% of the time for the first sweater.

$$90\%\ of\ 14\ hours = 0.90 \times 14 = 12.6$$

The second sweater took 12.6 hours to knit, so the third sweater took
10% less time than that. We can use our new shortcut of finding 90% of
the time for the second sweater, but remember that we are finding 90% of
the time for the second sweater, which was less time than the first
sweater.

$$90\%\ of\ 12.6\ hours = 0.90 \times 12.6 = 11.34$$

The third sweater took 11.34 hours to knit, which is closest to choice
C.
