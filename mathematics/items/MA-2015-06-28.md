For the Blake family, 3 drinks cost 3d dollars, and 2
snacks cost 2s dollars. They spent 12 dollars total, which we can write
as

3d + 2s = 12

For the Reese family, 2 drinks cost 2d dollars, and 4 snacks cost 4s
dollars. They spent 16 dollars total, which we can write as

2d + 4s = 16

There are several ways to solve *2 equations in 2 unknowns* (the
mathematical way to say that we have two equations that both use the
same two variables). Here is one way:

Let’s re-write the Reese family to solve for d:

> 2d + 4s = 16
>
> Subtract 4s from both sides: 2d = 16 – 4s
>
> Divide both sides by 2: d = 8 – 2s

We can now go back to the Blake family equation, and substitute this
expression for d:

> 3d + 2s = 12
>
> Substitute d = 8 – 2s: 3(8 – 2s) + 2s = 12

Use the distributive property to evaluate the parentheses: 3·8 - 3·2s +
2s = 12

> Combine like terms: 24 – 4s = 12
>
> Subtract 24 from both sides: - 4s = 12 – 24
>
> -4s = -12
>
> Divide both sides by -4: s = 3

A snack costs \$3. We were asked to find the cost of a drink, so we can
use the equation for either family to find the value of d. Using the
Blake family equation:

3d + 2s = 12

3d + 2(3) = 12

3d + 6 = 12

3d = 6

d = 2

So a drink costs \$2.

You can check that these results make sense by using s=\$3 and d=\$2 in
the equation for the Reese family.
